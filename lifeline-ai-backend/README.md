Emergency Dispatch Conversation/Copilot Al

Some Context:
The person who answers a call to an emergency number (think 911) is called the Dispatcher. The Dispatcher's ability to triage, navigate, and correctly advise urgent and life-threatening situations is of mission-critical importance. Yet, too often, Dispatchers are either not well trained, not too experienced, their training is out of date relative to evidence-based practice, or their guidebooks and manuals are similarly out of date.

Challenge:
Design and prototype a Conversational Al that can either listen in or respond to quick prompts that surfaces evidence-based practices in emergency response settings.
Ideas:
While an amazing Conversational Al assistant that listens and surfaces practices and protocols in real time would be game changing, the regulatory system and liability insurance regime would squash it's adoption. So, maybe think of it first as a "simulator" - it can help a dispatcher rehearse various life threatening scenarios, or a "feedback engine" -- it can listen or get text transcription of a conversation and give feedback on "opportunities for improvement.

Making this accurate and life saving would require a "Custom Large Language Model" or at least a custom extension to a Layer One LLM. Building a thoughtful prototype User Experience/Interface and using Chat-GPT or one of the other APIs will suffice.
